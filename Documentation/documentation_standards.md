# Doc Standards

`minimum:`
- All classes and methods will be documented with a docstring (`///`)
- Code that isn't immediately obvious will be documented
- Documentation will be updated where appropriate when updating existing methods, properties, etc...

`recommended:`
- When feasible, a markdown file (i.e. `readme.md`) will be created outlining properties, methods, classes, structs, etc... (where applicable)
